Temaki
============

Temaki is an Android app for quickly creating simple lists.

Try the app on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jmartin.temaki)

Android Libraries
==============

Temaki uses the following third-party libraries:

  - Google GSON

# Sync

Dropbox Sync was initially planned for version 1.5, but was dropped due to complications with conflicting methods of using list
names as tables names in the Dropbox Datastore API. Sync has been deferred for now due to my personal time constraints, with no 
plans to continue it at the moment.

However, there is still a desire to add Sync to Dropbox, and any help is appreciated!


Android Device Support
===================

Temaki is supported on all Android devices running Jelly Bean 4.1 and higher.

Part of the reason for the API 16 requirement is the use of fontFamily (weak excuse, I know), but as Android adoption rates continue to favour the 4.1+ versions, I have no plans to lower the requirement (for now).

Android Tablet Support
===================

There are currently no plans to have it supported for Android tablets, but I'm always evaluating after each version release.
